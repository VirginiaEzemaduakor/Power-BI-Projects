## Introduction

Nestlé is a global leader in the food and beverage industry, operating in over 190 countries with more than 400 factories worldwide. Guided by its mission “Good Food, Good Life”, Nestlé delivers a wide range of products including beverages, dairy, confectionery, and nutrition items.

This case study analyzes product sales over the past three years to uncover performance trends, highlight strengths and weaknesses, and recommend strategies that can support market growth and business expansion.


## Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis is a publicly available Excel file provided by 10Alytics for the internship project. It covers three years of Nestlé product sales data, including sales ID, date, product name, total revenue, sales location, and sales channel.

The dataset was imported into Power BI for analysis. Data preparation involved cleaning and transforming data types, merging queries, creating a calendar table with DAX, and applying changes to ensure accuracy and consistency.


## Tailored Analysis

The analysis focused on the following key areas:

- Total sales per product over the last 3 years.

- Monthly and yearly sales trends to identify growth patterns.

- Top and bottom-performing products by revenue.

- Regional performance, highlighting locations with the highest and lowest sales.

- Interactive dashboard summarizing all findings for decision-making.

 
## Findings 

**Product Sales:**

- Milo recorded the highest revenue ($5.95M), followed by Nescafé ($5.54M).

- Other strong performers included KitKat, Maggi, and Nestea.

- Lower-performing products contributed significantly less to total revenue.

**Trends:**

- Milo and Nescafé showed consistent growth across all three years.

- Seasonal peaks occurred in Q4, likely linked to festive demand.

**Market Channels:**

- Direct sales dominated overall revenue.

- Online sales underperformed, especially for flagship products like Milo.

**Regional Performance:**

- Certain regions showed strong sales potential, while others underperformed due to weaker distribution networks.


## Recommendations

- **Enhance Marketing:** Invest in digital campaigns, influencer partnerships, and targeted ads to boost awareness.
 
- **Flexible Packaging:** Introduce smaller, affordable pack sizes to reach lower-income households and price-sensitive markets.

- **Expand Distribution:** Improve logistics and retail presence, especially in rural or underserved areas.

- **Leverage Customer Insights:** Collect and analyze consumer feedback to tailor products and campaigns.

- **Optimize Supply Chain:** Establish regional hubs closer to demand centers to reduce delivery time and costs.



## Conclusion

The analysis highlights strong performance from products like Milo and Nescafé, while also revealing gaps in online sales and regional coverage. By improving marketing, packaging, distribution, customer insights, and supply chain efficiency, Nestlé can maximize existing product potential and lay the foundation for successful expansion into new product lines.
